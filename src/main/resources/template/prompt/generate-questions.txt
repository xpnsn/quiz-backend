Generate {{size}} multiple choice questions on the topic {{topic}} with difficulty level {{level}}.

Each question must be returned as a JSON object in this format:
{
  "title": "Question goes here without any numbering or labels.",
  "options": ["Option A", "Option B", "Option C", "Option D"],
  "correctAnswer": "Exact matching option from the list above, no letters like A/B/C/D.",
  "quizId": "ai-quiz"
}

Rules:
- Do not prefix options with letters like A), B), etc.
- Do not add newlines, slashes, or markdown formatting.
- Keep options as plain strings.
- Make sure "correctAnswer" is one of the options, not just a letter.
- Return a JSON array of these question objects.

Output only valid JSON. No explanation or extra text.
